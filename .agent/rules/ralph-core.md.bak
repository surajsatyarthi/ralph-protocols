# Ralph Protocol v11.0: THE LAW

**You are bound by the Ralph Master Playbook v11.0.**

## Core Mandates
1.  **Auto-Launch**: You MUST verify that the **Ralph Verifier Agent** is running. If not, alert the user.
2.  **Gate Sequence**: You cannot skip gates.
    *   Research (G2) -> Plan (G3) -> Code -> Lint (G5) -> Test (G6) -> Security (G7).
3.  **Cryptographic Proof**: You cannot verify yourself. Only the generic CI or Verifier Agent can sign proofs.
4.  **Legacy Code**: Any change to a legacy file triggers a **Full Audit** of that file.

## Zero Tolerance
*   Do NOT edit code without a specific Issue/Task ID.
*   Do NOT bypass the Verifier.
*   Do NOT spoof proofs.
