# 💬 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
## How CEO, PM, and Coder Communicate During MVP Development

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**For**: CEO, PM (Claude Code), Coder (Antigravity)

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**PM and Coder CANNOT communicate directly.**

**CEO is the notification layer** - NOT the data entry layer.

**All communication happens in PROJECT_LEDGER.md** under specific task entries.

---

## 👥 ROLES

### CEO
**Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Notify PM when Coder updates ledger
- ✅ Notify Coder when PM updates ledger
- ✅ Approve major decisions (PRDs, pivots, deployments)

**Does NOT**:
- ❌ Copy-paste messages between PM and Coder
- ❌ Edit ledger content
- ❌ Make technical decisions

**Workload**: ~5 notifications per day (30 seconds each)

---

### PM (Claude Code)
**Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Create PRDs and tasks in ledger
- ✅ Review Coder's work via ledger comments
- ✅ Validate code submissions (gate checks)
- ✅ Approve task completions
- ✅ Add comments directly to ledger

**Does NOT**:
- ❌ Write code (tokens too expensive)
- ❌ Wait for CEO to relay messages

**Communication**: Edits PROJECT_LEDGER.md → Notifies CEO

---

### Coder (Antigravity)
**Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Implement tasks from ledger
- ✅ Update task status in ledger
- ✅ Add git commits and evidence
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions via ledger comments
- ✅ Submit work for QA via ledger

**Does NOT**:
- ❌ Wait for CEO to relay messages
- ❌ Create PRDs (PM does this)

**Communication**: Edits PROJECT_LEDGER.md → Notifies CEO

---

## 🔄 COMMUNICATION WORKFLOW

### Scenario 1: PM Assigns Task to Coder

**Step 1**: PM opens `PROJECT_LEDGER.md`

**Step 2**: PM finds entry (e.g., ENTRY-015 - Fix lint error)

**Step 3**: PM adds comment:
```markdown
## 💬 COMMENTS (PM ↔ Coder via CEO)

[2026-02-11 18:00] PM → Coder:
🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY - This task blocks all commits.
RICE Score: 3,600 (2nd highest).
Please fix Next.js lint configuration ASAP.
Notify CEO when complete with git commit hash.
```

**Step 4**: PM saves and commits ledger

**Step 5**: PM tells CEO: *"I updated ledger with task assignment for ENTRY-015. Please notify Coder."*

**Step 6**: CEO tells Coder: *"Check PROJECT_LEDGER.md - new task assigned (ENTRY-015)"*

**Step 7**: Coder opens ledger → Reads PM's comment → Starts work

---

### Scenario 2: Coder Completes Task

**Step 1**: Coder finishes work (fixes lint error)

**Step 2**: Coder commits code:
```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve Next.js lint configuration error"
# Gets git hash: a1b2c3d4
```

**Step 3**: Coder opens `PROJECT_LEDGER.md`

**Step 4**: Coder updates ENTRY-015:
```markdown
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Git Hash**: a1b2c3d4
**Evidence**: docs/evidence/entry-015-lint-fixed.png
```

**Step 5**: Coder adds comment:
```markdown
[2026-02-11 20:30] Coder → PM:
✅ Task COMPLETED.
- Fixed Next.js lint config (updated next.config.js)
- All linting errors resolved
- Pre-commit hook now working
- Git commit: a1b2c3d4
- Evidence: Screenshot attached showing `npm run lint` passing

Ready for QA validation.
```

**Step 6**: Coder saves and commits ledger

**Step 7**: Coder tells CEO: *"I completed ENTRY-015 and updated ledger. Please notify PM for QA review."*

**Step 8**: CEO tells PM: *"Check PROJECT_LEDGER.md - Coder completed ENTRY-015"*

**Step 9**: PM opens ledger → Reads Coder's comment → Validates work

---

### Scenario 3: PM Validates and Approves

**Step 1**: PM reads Coder's completion comment in ENTRY-015

**Step 2**: PM checks evidence:
- Views screenshot: `docs/evidence/entry-015-lint-fixed.png`
- Verifies git commit exists: `a1b2c3d4`
- Runs local validation (if possible)

**Step 3**: PM adds approval comment:
```markdown
[2026-02-11 21:00] PM → Coder:
✅ APPROVED - Task verified and passing all gates.
- Checked git commit a1b2c3d4 ✅
- Viewed evidence screenshot ✅
- Lint configuration fixed ✅
- Pre-commit hook functional ✅

Status: COMPLETED ✅
Next task: ENTRY-002 (Install Playwright, RICE: 4,000)
Check ledger for details.
```

**Step 4**: PM updates ENTRY-015 status to COMPLETED in statistics

**Step 5**: PM saves and commits ledger

**Step 6**: PM tells CEO: *"I approved ENTRY-015 and assigned ENTRY-002. Please notify Coder."*

**Step 7**: CEO tells Coder: *"Check PROJECT_LEDGER.md - ENTRY-015 approved, new task assigned (ENTRY-002)"*

---

### Scenario 4: Coder Needs Clarification

**Step 1**: Coder reads task ENTRY-008 (Payment System)

**Step 2**: Coder has question about requirements

**Step 3**: Coder adds comment to ENTRY-008:
```markdown
[2026-02-12 10:00] Coder → PM:
❓ CLARIFICATION NEEDED:

For the payment system, the PRD mentions "80/20 split" but doesn't specify:
1. Do we split on gross amount or after payment gateway fees?
2. Who pays the Razorpay transaction fee (2.5%)?
   - Option A: Deduct from creator's 80%
   - Option B: Deduct from platform's 20%
   - Option C: Add to total (buyer pays extra)

Please advise before I implement the calculation logic.

BLOCKED until clarification received.
```

**Step 4**: Coder updates task status:
```markdown
**Status**: BLOCKED
```

**Step 5**: Coder saves and commits ledger

**Step 6**: Coder tells CEO: *"I need PM clarification on ENTRY-008 (payment split calculation). Updated ledger. BLOCKED."*

**Step 7**: CEO tells PM: *"Check PROJECT_LEDGER.md - Coder has question on ENTRY-008 (BLOCKED)"*

**Step 8**: PM reads question → Consults CEO if needed → Responds in ledger

---

### Scenario 5: PM Provides Clarification

**Step 1**: PM reads Coder's question in ENTRY-008

**Step 2**: PM consults CEO (if business decision needed)

**Step 3**: PM adds response:
```markdown
[2026-02-12 11:30] PM → Coder:
✅ CLARIFICATION PROVIDED:

**80/20 Split Calculation**:
1. Split happens on NET amount (after Razorpay fees)
   - Example: Sale = ₹100
   - Razorpay fee (2.5%) = ₹2.50
   - Net amount = ₹97.50
   - Creator gets: ₹97.50 × 80% = ₹78
   - Platform gets: ₹97.50 × 20% = ₹19.50

2. Razorpay fees deducted BEFORE split (neither party pays directly)

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const saleAmount = 100;
const razorpayFee = saleAmount * 0.025; // 2.5%
const netAmount = saleAmount - razorpayFee;
const creatorEarnings = netAmount * 0.80;
const platformFee = netAmount * 0.20;
```

Task UNBLOCKED. Proceed with implementation.
CEO approved this approach.
```

**Step 4**: PM updates task status:
```markdown
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS (unblocked)
```

**Step 5**: PM saves and commits ledger

**Step 6**: PM tells CEO: *"I clarified ENTRY-008 payment split logic. Please notify Coder - task unblocked."*

**Step 7**: CEO tells Coder: *"Check PROJECT_LEDGER.md - ENTRY-008 clarification provided, unblocked"*

---

## 📋 COMMENT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

### Template

## 📊 CEO NOTIFICATION TEMPLATES & SHAREABLE PROMPTS

### 🚨 MANDATORY SHAREABLE PROMPT FORMAT

**Every message from PM or Coder to CEO MUST end with this section:**

```markdown
---
📋 SHAREABLE PROMPT FOR CEO

Copy-paste to [PM/Coder]:

"[Clear, concise message that CEO copies directly to the other party]"
```

**Why**: CEO should never have to parse long messages. Just copy the text in the box and send it.

## 📈 METRICS TO TRACK

**CEO Dashboard** (optional, track if desired):

### Communication Metrics:
- Average response time (CEO → notification)
- Average PM review time (comment → approval)
- Number of blockers per week
- Clarification requests per week

### Velocity Metrics:
- Tasks completed per week
- Average task completion time
- Pre-commit hook blocks (should decrease to zero)

### Quality Metrics:
- QA pass rate (target: >90%)
- Rework requests (target: <10%)
- Gate failures (should be zero)

---

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

**Monthly Review** (CEO + PM):
- Is communication workflow working?
- Are response times acceptable?
- Should we adjust notification frequency?
- Any process bottlenecks?

**Update This Doc** if workflow changes.

---

## 📝 CHANGE LOG

| Date | Change | By |
|------|--------|-----|
| 2026-02-11 | Created communication protocol | PM |

---

## 🎯 SUMMARY (TL;DR)

1. **PM and Coder edit PROJECT_LEDGER.md directly** - add comments under task entries
2. **CEO is notified** - relays "check ledger" to other party
3. **CEO does NOT copy-paste** - just notifies
4. **All communication is in ledger** - single source of truth
5. **Timestamped, auditable, traceable** - blockchain-style

**CEO workload**: ~5 notifications/day × 30 seconds = 2.5 minutes/day

**PM/Coder benefit**: Direct communication via ledger, zero message loss, full context preserved

---

**This is the OFFICIAL communication protocol for MVP development.**

**Any deviations require CEO approval and doc update.**
